This book is written using Libre Office. 
Unfortunately Git Hub does not support Libre Office and does not show changes between the commits easily.
Since the book is written in Libre Office format, changes between commits can be easily viewed using Libre Office. 
For example, to compare the current version of the book with commit A, first download the version from commit A. 
Then, open the current version in Libre Office, go to Edit > Track Changes > Compare Document, and select the version from commit A.
